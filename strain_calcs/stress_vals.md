# Current Script Information

Takes in stress from the a given reference axis, and returns the strain matrix (should change it give the sum of the sheer and axial stress in each direction).

## Reference Axis Currently scripted for

X = [1 0 0]
Y = [0 $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ $-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$]
Z = [0 $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$]
