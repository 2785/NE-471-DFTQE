# NE471 Student Project: DFT Quantum Espresso Simulation

This project holds the code and data produced to fulfill the NE471 final project. 

The go module component of the project is used for parsing the output data of the quantum hub simulations, `strain_calcs` contains the strain solver given a stress value as well as the simulation outputs, `plots` contains the python script used to generate the plots.
